            <article class="patch-type">
                <h3>Embroidered Patches</h3>
                <h4>Definition and Characteristics:</h4>
                <p>Embroidered patches are made by stitching thread onto a fabric backing. The embroidery process creates a textured and raised design that can add a sophisticated look to the patch. Typically, these patches are made using a combination of thread colors to achieve detailed and intricate designs.</p>
                
                <h4>Advantages and Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Embroidered patches are known for their durability and high-quality appearance. They are also versatile and can be applied to a variety of fabrics, including denim, leather, and cotton. The raised texture adds a tactile element to the design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> While durable, embroidered patches may not capture very fine details as effectively as other types of patches. They can also be more expensive to produce, especially for complex designs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Popular Uses and Applications:</h4>
                <p>Embroidered patches are commonly used for uniforms, corporate branding, sports teams, and military insignia. They are ideal for situations where a classic, professional look is desired.</p>

                <h3>Woven Patches</h3>
                <h4>Definition and Characteristics:</h4>
                <p>Woven patches are created by weaving threads together to form the design. This type of patch has a flat surface, as opposed to the raised texture of embroidered patches. Woven patches are known for their fine detail and ability to reproduce complex designs with high precision.</p>
                
                <h4>Advantages and Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Woven patches are excellent for detailed and intricate designs, including small text and fine lines. They are generally more cost-effective for large quantities compared to embroidered patches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Woven patches lack the texture and dimensionality of embroidered patches, which might be a downside if you prefer a more tactile element.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Popular Uses and Applications:</h4>
                <p>These patches are often used for fashion labels, name tags, and products that require fine detailing. They are suitable for applications where precision and clarity of design are crucial.</p>

                <h3>PVC Patches</h3>
                <h4>Definition and Characteristics:</h4>
                <p>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) patches are made from a flexible, rubber-like material that can be molded into various shapes and sizes. The design is created using a 3D molding process, which allows for intricate and vibrant designs with a high level of detail.</p>
                
                <h4>Advantages and Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> PVC patches are highly durable, water-resistant, and suitable for outdoor use. They are also versatile in terms of shape and color, and their 3D effect adds a modern touch.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> PVC patches can be less breathable than fabric patches and may not be as comfortable on clothing. They can also be more expensive than some other types.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Popular Uses and Applications:</h4>
                <p>PVC patches are commonly used for outdoor gear, tactical vests, and promotional items. They are ideal for situations where durability and a 3D effect are desired.</p>

                <h4>Definition and Characteristics:</h4>
                <p>Printed patches are created using digital printing technology to transfer an image or design directly onto a fabric backing. This type of patch allows for high-resolution designs and a wide range of colors.</p>
                
                <h4>Advantages and Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Printed patches can reproduce complex and colorful designs with ease. They are often more affordable for small quantities and can include photographic-quality images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> The durability of printed patches may be less compared to embroidered or PVC patches, as the print can fade or peel over time. They are generally best suited for short-term use.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Popular Uses and Applications:</h4>
                <p>These patches are popular for promotional events, temporary branding, and fashion items where high-detail designs and vibrant colors are needed.</p>

                <h4>Advantages and Disadvantages:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Leather patches are durable and have a distinctive texture that can enhance the aesthetic of garments and accessories. They also age well, often developing a patina over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Leather patches can be more expensive and may require special care to maintain their appearance. They may also not be suitable for all fabrics.</li>
                </ul>
